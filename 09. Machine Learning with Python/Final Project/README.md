# Machine Learning with Python - The Best Classifier

## 📄 Summary
This project involved completing a notebook to build a classifier that predicts whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

## 📝Method
A historical dataset from previous loan applications is loaded, the data is cleaned, and then split into a testing dataset and a training dataset. 
Tthe following classification algorithms are trained using the training data, and the corresponding ski-kit learn libraries:

- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics:
- Jaccard index 
- F1-score
- LogLoss (for logistic regression)
