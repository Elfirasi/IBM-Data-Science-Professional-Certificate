# Model Development

## Context 
The attached notebook shows the development and visualization of several models that predict the price of a car using the variables or features within the dataset. This allows for an estimate of how much a car should cost.

Following the notebook will allow for an understanding of the model types, and how appropriate they are.

## Model Types Used
The following model types are considered:
- Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression


## Pipelines
There are many steps to getting a prediction. For example, normalization, polynomial transform, and linear regression. These processes are simplifiedusing a pipeline. Pipeline sequentially perform a series of transformations. To do so, the module `Pipeline` is used here to create a pipeline.
